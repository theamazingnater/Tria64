# Tria64
a LUA remake of the Commodore 64 OS.
This really isn't a complete remake, there's only a few commands so far, which aren't from the original OS. 

# Commands
loop - Loops a sound that's already been requested, can be used for music

play - Plays a sound with a requested ID. It's just the asset ID, not "rbxassetid" or anything.

erase - Erases the entire screen except for "READY." The code will automatically do this if there's too many lines on screen.

help - Old command that used to list all commands. This was before I created this repository.

info - Information about the OS.

stop - Stops a currently playing sound. 

# Joke Commands
In other words, commands that I added because I was bored and had no ideas for useful commands.

roblox - The computer tells you that you are indeed playing Roblox.

amogus - amogus

# What do you plan for this?
Well, quite a bit actually! I'm planning to have most, if not all, of the original commands.
